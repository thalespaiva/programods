A Python package for representing and querying **Pro**babilistic **Gra**phical **Mod**el**s**.

### Core Philosophy ###
 - Code that is easy to read is favored over efficient code
 - It should help students to visualize and understand Probabilistic Models concepts
 - The dificulties of implementations should be clear, and not delegated to another Python library
 - No use of other libraries for probablistic graphical models (corolary of the above, but equally important)

### Supported Probabilistic Models ###

Currently the following are implemented:

- **Probabilistic Logic**
  - ...
- **Bayesian Networks**
  - ...
- **Markov Networks**
  - ...
